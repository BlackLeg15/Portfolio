            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Adby Santos </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Para√≠ba, Brasil.</span>
            <br />I've been a professional Mobile Apps Developer with Flutter, a Google's framework, since 2020. I've worked on over a dozen apps from several businesses, like security, education and entertainment.
            <br />I'm graduated with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology (BIT) at UFERSA Pau dos Ferros.
            <br />
            Additionally, I'm a teacher and mentor at FTeam. Together, we've helped <span className="purple"> over one hundred people</span> to leverage Flutter to their companies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
